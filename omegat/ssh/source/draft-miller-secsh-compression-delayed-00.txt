Abstract

   This memo describes a new compression method for the SSH protocol.
   This new method uses the same zlib compression algorithm as the
   existing method described in the core SSH drafts but delays the start
   of compression until after user authentication has completed.  This
   eliminates the risk of a bug in compression libraries resulting in a
   pre-authentication compromise of an SSH server.

Internet-Draft   SSH zlib@openssh.com compression method   November 2006


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Overview

   SSH [RFC4251] is a popular protocol for secure remote login and data
   transfer on the Internet.  Included in the protocol is the ability to
   compress data between the client and the server, offering throughput
   improvements and traffic savings when used on compressible data.

   The "zlib" compression in method defined in [RFC4253] for the SSH
   protocol uses ZLIB (LZ77) compression (as described in [RFC1950] and
   [RFC1951]).  This method activates compression after the completion
   of the key exchange algorithm, upon the receipt of the
   SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS message.  This step occurs before user authentication
   [RFC4252] completes, so a bug in the underlying compression code
   could be exposed to unauthenticated users.

   This new compression method "zlib@openssh.com" addresses this risk by
   delaying the start of compression until the completion of the user
   authentication exchange.


3.  Delayed Compression

   The "zlib@openssh.com" method operates identically to the "zlib"
   method described in [RFC4252] except that packet compression does not
   start until the server sends a SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS packet,
   replacing the "zlib" method's start of compression when the server
   sends SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS.

   Specifically, this means that a server selecting this method MUST
   compress the first packet after SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS and all
   subsequent packets.  The client MUST compress all packets it sends
   after the time that it receives SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS.

   An implementation of this method should be careful to ensure that
   compression is enabled by subsequent re-keying exchanges after
   authentication.


4.  Security Considerations

   Delaying compression until after authentication may reveal slightly

   more exact information about the length of authentication data.  It
   is doubtful that this would assist an attacker; the compressed length
   of an authentication secret is of similar interest to an attacker as
   its uncompressed length.  Implementations should be taking steps to
   obscure the exact length of authentication secrets anyway.

   The security considerations in [RFC4251] also apply to this
   compression method.
